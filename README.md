# First-HTMLCSS-after-Return-From-Dead
I admit it in 2020 is really tough year for us because of pandemic and this resp just for fun reminder for my self...when i try to start learn html and css from zero after I finished my previous project of Excel VBA Point of Sale(and seems like the prospect of excel vba is not good as it is), 

I think after finishing Excel vba Project, I just Addicted to code and became self taught programmer....
the philosophy I apply to learn coding for this decade is, "Just dont being a programmer,.....be a Problem Solver"

#still Learn

I had no Formal Education background of IT btw 
Back then When in College my Major is Financial Management of Padjadjaran University Indonesia

I think I found some part of myself who already lost few years ago in Programming World
Right Now I Interest to learn node js, Expressjs, and React....thanks to God I already had some Project to work with

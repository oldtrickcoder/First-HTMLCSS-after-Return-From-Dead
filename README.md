# First-HTMLCSS-after-Return-From-Dead
I admit it in 2020 is really tough year for us because of pandemic and this resp just for fun reminder for my self...when i try to start learn html and css from zero after I finished my previous project of Excel VBA Point of Sale(and seems like the prospect of excel vba is not good as it is), 

I think after finishing Excel vba Project, I just Addicted to code and became self taught programmer....
the philosophy I apply to learn coding for this decade is, "Just dont being a programmer,.....be a Problem Solver"

#still Learn

I had no Formal Education background of IT btw 
Back then When in College my Major is Financial Management of Padjadjaran University Indonesia

I think I found some part of myself who already lost few years ago in Programming World
Right Now I Interest to learn node js, Expressjs, and React....thanks to God I already had some Project to work with 


# My Story After Several Years pasted
Is in the edge of 2022 right now when I wrote this text, almost next two weeks will reach the beginning 0f 2023, many project Came to me as Software Engineer from zero to Hero Right now I maintained several company  as a freelancer also as hired Software engineer for both Microsoft Excel VBA and WebApps Developer .
Everythings Can Happen in the future, I remember back then 8 years ago when I almost graduate from college, my friends of mine tell me that "is such a waste of time to doing a computer programming work , many programmers was hired  with a bad Incentive but doing A big task and several programers don't have any good futures life"

   But my Life Story tell otherwise , after several years I spent to do small Management Consultant business for several business in Indonesia, Covid19 change everything for everything I do for my daily activity since that I did Computer Programming as an Hobby , and Now I doing Computer Programming as a Profesional Career.
